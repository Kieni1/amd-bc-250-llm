# BC-250 support / operations handover — current source 0.11.3-2.2

This handover is for the real-device support/operations lane: service topology, model lifecycle
operations, storage, maintenance/backups, power/WOL, Open WebUI operational integration and bounded
hardware regression. Semantic model promotion remains a main/quality decision.

## Authority and evidence boundary

Use newest source/package first, then exact installed device evidence. Current source:

```text
VERSION:      0.11.3
RPM Release:  2.2
NVR:          bc250-llm-server-0.11.3-2.2
```

2.2 carries forward the focused 1.8 support/model-manager safety release and 2.1 RAG/evidence cleanup, while adding only the completed MTP catalog policy and developer build-regeneration refinements. The inherited safety fixes are:

- safe-power local/peer endpoint parsing;
- a narrow forced-command Pi self-SSH exemption while preserving second-SSH/UI/Ollama deferral;
- non-blocking final power requests;
- healthy live-40CU rc=0 when persistent activation is intentionally disabled;
- model-manager `apply all all` guidance and malformed overlay visibility;
- protected-state/status wording, maintenance enabled/disabled wording and small-file prune sizes;
- Stage-7 MTP presentation;
- the existing ISTA Qwen3.8 IQ3_XXS experiment's safer 8K context with the same verified GGUF.

Newest full device qualification is exact installed `0.11.3-1.7.fc44.x86_64`:

```text
core verify          54 / 0 / 0
infrastructure       PASS
quality              8/8 PASS
restoration          PASS
coverage             FULL
```

The exact-1.7 support campaign separately proved normal↔agent restoration, degraded-mode
recovery, fresh verified config/users backups and prune dry-run, then stopped after finding the
safe-power and 40-CU return-code defects now fixed in 1.8 and carried into 2.2. Real idle S5/WOL, Pi forced-command
shutdown, backup restore and live prune are therefore **pending exact-2.2 tests**, not accepted
historical behavior.

Evidence files:

```text
development/model-runs/2026-09-20-installed-0.11.3-1.7-revalidation.md
development/model-runs/2026-09-20-installed-0.11.3-1.7-support-maintenance.md
```

Do not relabel those results as 2.2 qualification.

## Validation ownership

```text
GitHub       RPM/SRPM/package builds
workstation  Ruff/developer linting
BC-250       hardware, services, models, Open WebUI, backup/restore, power/WOL
```

Current 2.2 source validation is recorded in `PATCHNOTE-0.11.3-2.2.md`. Exact installed-2.2 execution is the outstanding hardware gate; RPM/SRPM build evidence remains external.

## Service topology

```text
ollama.service            main       11434
ollama-task.service       task       11435
ollama-agent.service      agent      11436; exclusive and inactive in normal mode
ollama-embedding.service  embedding  11437
open-webui.service        application
nginx.service             office-facing HTTP :80 / readiness path
tika.service              private document extraction
```

Normal mode: main/task/embedding active, agent inactive. Agent mode: 11436 active, normal Ollama
lanes inactive. `bc250-agent-mode status` is the topology authority and must distinguish
`normal / agent / degraded / stopped`.

Internal 3000/11434-11437 are not Pi readiness endpoints. Use nginx/Open WebUI HTTP :80 for office
readiness and SSH :22 only for administration/restricted maintenance.

Current runtime pins come from `config/runtime.env`:

```text
Ollama       0.34.0
Open WebUI   0.11.3
Tika         4.0.0-full
```

## Current production roles relevant to operations

```text
standard office     prod-gemma4-e2b-unsloth-qat-ud-q4-k-xl
RAG answer          prod-gemma4-e4b-unsloth-qat-ud-q4-k-xl
translation         prod-translate-gemma4-sub-e4b-17s-q4-k-xl
higher-quality      prod-qwen35-9b-unsloth-q6-k
deep/memory edge    prod-gpt-oss20b-ggml-org-mxfp4
embedding           embed-jina-v5-small-retrieval-q4-k-m
task                task-lfm25-1.2b-instruct-liquidai-q6-k
agent baseline      agentic-ornith15-9b-ornith-q5-k-m
```

MTP is not another Ollama lane. Installer Stage 7 shows MTP state read-only but never fetches it.
Direct `bc250-run-mtp` drains Ollama residency and restores the captured set; comparison uses
specialist drain-only isolation and leaves Ollama cold.

## Hardware/resource facts for operations

- 16 GB GDDR6 is one shared CPU/GPU pool; do not add RAM/VRAM/GTT/Vulkan views.
- Live routing can be healthy at 40/40 even when kernel/RADV numeric counters show 24.
- Live 40-CU routing is operator-controlled; persistent 40-CU boot activation may intentionally be
  disabled and must not make healthy live status fail.
- Governor policy remains approximately 350–1850 MHz with 85 C throttle target.
- Hard MemAvailable floor is 128 MiB; <512 MiB is tight-headroom diagnostic territory.
- GPT-OSS + Jina is the credible memory edge; exact-1.7 passed with 167 MiB minimum MemAvailable.

## Model lifecycle safety

Use the current grammar:

```text
bc250-model list [CATEGORY]
sudo bc250-model status [CATEGORY] [SELECTION] [--online]
bc250-model path CATEGORY ID
sudo bc250-model apply CATEGORY [SELECTION]
sudo bc250-model refresh CATEGORY [SELECTION]
sudo bc250-model unregister CATEGORY [SELECTION]
sudo bc250-model remove CATEGORY [SELECTION]
sudo bc250-model purge-retired
```

Category `all` does not itself select every model. Explicit all-model convergence is
`sudo bc250-model apply all all`.

For support testing, prefer `unregister -> apply` so the manager reuses the verified GGUF. Avoid
`refresh`, `remove` and source pruning unless source destruction/redownload is the actual test goal.
Manager-owned GGUF paths are protected; shell existence/stat probes from `llm_admin` must use sudo.

`/etc/bc250-llm-server/models.d/` is an operator override directory. Packaged definitions are not
expected to appear there. Visible operator definitions must have a `.Modelfile` suffix and matching
model metadata/name.

## Storage lessons to preserve

Ollama imports can temporarily amplify storage by keeping source GGUFs plus import/live blobs. Normal
Ollama lifecycle may remove unreferenced blobs; do not manually delete them merely because onboarding
looks temporarily large.

For byte-identical retained GGUF/live Ollama blobs on XFS, prefer package dedupe over deleting GGUFs.
Preserve verified source/state so registration can be rebuilt locally.

Known gap: arbitrary out-of-band same-name Ollama registration mutation is not fully detected when
source/template state is unchanged.

## Local maintenance and backup contract

Stable interfaces:

```text
sudo bc250-maintenance status
sudo bc250-maintenance setup
sudo bc250-maintenance run backup
sudo bc250-maintenance run prune
sudo bc250-maintenance request-shutdown
sudo bc250-maintenance companion status
sudo bc250-maintenance companion enable
sudo bc250-maintenance backup-export status
sudo bc250-maintenance backup-export enable
```

Current design:

- config/users backups are local and independent of Pi;
- backups are private and verified, not merely created;
- restore requires Open WebUI stopped, validates archive/database state and preserves rollback
  material;
- pruning starts `DRY_RUN=1` and fails safe on uncertain metadata;
- warm-up/night power are optional; status must distinguish disabled schedules from retained
  configured values;
- backup export is a separate read-only identity and optional;
- active maintenance jobs defer power actions.

## Safe-power / Pi contract

The BC-250 owns the shutdown decision. The Pi may request it but must not execute raw remote
`systemctl poweroff` as the normal interface.

Public operator path:

```text
sudo bc250-maintenance request-shutdown
```

This must defer if the current interactive SSH connection, UI/Ollama protected TCP activity or a
maintenance job is active.

Dedicated companion path:

```text
forced-command SSH identity
  -> sudo bc250-maintenance request-shutdown-companion
  -> safe-power helper with exact SSH_CONNECTION exemption
```

Only that authenticated control tuple may be ignored. Any additional SSH/protected connection must
still block poweroff. Missing/failed TCP inspection must defer.

WOL must be proven from real powered-off/S5 state before automatic after-hours poweroff is enabled.

## Immediate exact-2.2 changed-boundary checks

Run one bounded batch at a time. The minimum current-release device evidence is:

```text
1. install exact 0.11.3-2.2; record NEVRA + artifact SHA
2. sudo bc250-verify --owui-token-file FILE
3. interactive SSH request-shutdown -> DEFER, no shutdown broadcast/session loss
4. bc250-40cu status + verify -> healthy 40/40 and rc=0 with persistent mode disabled
```

Only add feature-specific checks when the feature is going into use: Pi companion requires
companion-only allow plus second-admin-SSH defer; unattended power requires one idle S5 -> WOL ->
HTTP :80 readiness cycle. Backup restore, unregister/apply lifecycle and destructive pruning remain
bounded support/product acceptance tasks rather than mandatory checks after every release.

Do not enable unattended night shutdown before the applicable SSH/companion/S5 guards are proven.

## UX acceptance during support tests

Do not judge only return codes. Record whether an operator can correctly understand the state:

- protected data should say protected/unavailable, not `0` or absent;
- normal inactive agent should read as intentional, not a scary conflict/failure;
- disabled warm-up/night power should be visibly disabled even if configuration values remain;
- small prune candidates should show meaningful B/KiB/MiB sizes;
- intentional degraded tests should produce a clear degraded summary and recover to normal;
- safe-power defer should return without broadcast/session loss;
- successful power allow should log the guard decision before the connection disappears.
